# Policy engine

This is what makes Svault *AI-aware*. There are two paths to a secret:

- **`svault secret get`** — the **human path**. Passphrase, no questions asked (audited).
- **The agent path** — a structured request an AI must justify, run through a pipeline and **enforced inside the daemon** so it can't be bypassed by talking to the socket directly. Agents reach it through the **MCP server** (`svault mcp`); the `svault get` CLI command is the same gate but is **deprecated** (it still works, and the examples below use it for brevity, but new integrations should use MCP — see [mcp.md](mcp.md)).

## Enforced, not advisory

The agent path is evaluated **where the key lives** — the daemon. An agent request
(`svault_get_secret` over MCP, or the deprecated `svault get`) becomes a structured
`GetGated` request; the daemon evaluates policy, consults the AI judge for sensitive
secrets, writes the audit record, and only then returns a value. When no daemon is
running, the CLI/MCP runs the **same** gate locally against an already-unlocked
session — a locked vault is refused (a human must `svault unlock` first); the agent
path never prompts. There is no unguarded read path.

Every decision is audited and stamped with the connecting process's **peer UID**
(unforgeable), alongside the self-asserted `--caller` string.

> **Threat model.** This enforces the gate for cooperative and semi-trusted
> agents and gives a tamper-resistant audit trail plus behavioural detection. It
> is **not** a sandbox against a hostile *same-UID* process, which can read the
> daemon's memory directly — that boundary is documented in [security.md](security.md).

## Step-by-step: set up and change policy and the judge

A full setup is four moves. Each is independent — do only what you need, and
re-run any step later to change things.

> **Targeting a vault.** You can have several vaults (local today, remote
> planned), so every secret/get/settings command takes `-v <vault>` (`--vault`).
> Omit it only when there's a single vault, or to be prompted to pick one. The
> examples below add `-v billing` to be explicit.

### 1. Classify your secrets (scope + tier + description)

Classification lives **AES-256-GCM encrypted inside the vault** (not the plaintext
`meta.yaml`), so a same-UID agent can neither read a secret's tier/scope/purpose to
plan a passing request nor tamper with it without the passphrase. Set it when you
add a secret, or re-run `secret add` on an existing name to **reclassify** it (the
value is preserved if you leave it unchanged). The optional
`--description` records *what the secret is for* — the AI judge weighs it against
the stated reason, so a request whose reason doesn't match the secret's purpose is
denied:

```bash
# Add and classify in one step (-v picks the vault)
svault secret add DB_PASSWORD -v billing --scope database --tier high \
  --description "production Postgres connection string"
svault secret add STRIPE_KEY  -v billing --scope payments --tier high --require-reason \
  --description "production Stripe charge key — only for billing/charge flows"
svault secret add ANALYTICS   -v billing --scope api --tier low

# Modify later — re-running with new flags updates the classification
svault secret add ANALYTICS   -v billing --scope api --tier medium \
  --description "read-only analytics API token"
```

Run `svault secret add NAME` with no flags to be prompted interactively for scope,
tier, and description (the tier defaults to the vault's `default_tier`). In the
TUI, `a` in the secret browser opens the same form (scope / description / tier /
require-reason). A `"*"` entry in the map is the default rule for any secret you
didn't classify. The vault's own description (set at `svault create` / in
settings) is also given to the judge as overall context.

### 2. Define who may ask (callers)

Caller rules (who holds which scopes, at what rate limit) live **encrypted inside
the vault**, alongside the classification — they're no longer a committable
`svault.policy.yaml`. Seed and inspect them (both unlock the vault):

```bash
svault policy init                # seed default callers into the vault's policy
svault policy check claude-code   # verify what that caller can now reach
```

To **change** a caller's access, edit it in `svault settings` (re-encrypts the
vault). When no caller rules are defined, caller authorization falls back to the
vault's `allow_agent` / `rate_limit`.

### 3. Turn on the AI judge (optional, for medium/high)

There is no plaintext config and no key file. Judges live in the AES-256-GCM
**encrypted keyring** (`.svault/keyring.enc`), opened by your **master passphrase**
(no separate keyring passphrase). You can define **multiple named judges**, each
with its own model, thresholds, free-text **criteria**, and API key. Create the
keyring, add a judge, enable the judge globally, then unlock — no secret is touched:

```bash
svault keyring init          # create the keyring under your master (one-time)
svault judge add strict      # prompts: model, thresholds, criteria, then the key (hidden)
svault judge enable          # flip the global on/off switch (on)
svault keyring unlock        # caches a 0600 session key so the judge is live this session
svault judge status          # keyring + global switch + judge registry
# Dry-run — pass a realistic --vault and the descriptions to see how they sway it:
svault judge test --judge strict \
  --reason "run the nightly db migration" --scope database --tier high \
  --vault billing-api --vault-description "production billing service" \
  --description "production Postgres connection string"
```

The first judge added becomes the keyring's **default**. A vault opts in to the
judge via its per-vault toggle at `svault create` or `svault settings` (and the
same forms in the TUI); it uses the keyring's default judge unless **assigned** a
specific one — the **Assigned judge** prompt in `svault create` / `svault settings`
(and the TUI Create / Settings picker). **Change** a judge's
model/thresholds/criteria with `svault judge edit <name>`; **rotate or clear** its
key with `svault judge set-key <name>` (a cleared key falls back to the opt-in
`$SVAULT_OPENROUTER_KEY`). In the **GUI** a judge instead references a named
**provider** (an API account in the keyring) and draws its key from there.
Until the keyring is unlocked the judge is off and the
static tier rules apply.

### 4. Make a request as the agent

```bash
svault get DB_PASSWORD -v billing --scope database \
  --reason "run the nightly migration" --caller claude-code
```

Granted → the value prints to stdout (+ an audit row); denied → non-zero exit with
a **generic** message (`denied: request not authorized for this secret`). The real
reason — judge score + rationale, scope/caller mismatch, rate limit — is recorded
only in the audit log, for you; the caller learns nothing it could use to refine a
denied request into a passing one. The judge sees the vault's and secret's
descriptions, so the reason has to fit what the secret is actually for. Review
history any time with `svault policy check <caller>`.

## The request pipeline

```bash
svault get DB_URL --scope database --reason "run nightly migration" --caller claude-code
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    REQ["svault get"] --> SEAL{"Secret sealed?"}
    SEAL -->|yes| DENY["Deny + audit"]
    SEAL -->|no| ID["Identify caller<br/>(--caller, else $SVAULT_CALLER, else default)"]
    ID --> RSN{"Reason valid?<br/>(>=10 chars, not a placeholder)"}

    JUDGE -->|allow| ALLOW
    JUDGE -->|deny| DENY
    DENY -.->|repeated denials<br/>on a medium/high secret| SEALIT["Seal + escalate to human"]
```

On **allow**, the value is printed to stdout (status goes to stderr, so an agent
capturing stdout gets only the value). On **deny**, `svault get` exits non-zero with
the generic message `denied: request not authorized for this secret`; the detailed
reason is logged for the human, not returned.

## Sensitivity tiers

Each secret is classified in the vault's **encrypted policy** (see below). With
the AI judge **enabled**:

| Tier | Agent behaviour |
|---|---|
| `low` | Auto-allow (the judge is consulted only if the secret is `require_reason`) |
| `medium` | **Judge-gated.** Allowed if the judge scores >= the allow threshold. If the judge is unavailable: **fail-open**, audit-flagged `judge-unavailable` |
| `high` | **Judge-gated**, stricter threshold. If the judge is unavailable: **fail-closed** (deny) |

With the judge **disabled** (keyring locked, global switch off, no resolved key, or
the vault's per-vault `judge.enabled = false`), behaviour falls back to the static
tier rules: low and medium allowed (medium flagged), **high = human-only**.

## Conditional access (windows + required callers)

A secret can carry **conditions** in its encrypted policy that narrow *when* and
*by whom* it may be retrieved. They are checked after the scope/caller checks and,
like every other denial, return the same generic message — an agent can't read the
window or the required-caller list to wait for it or impersonate its way in.

- **Time windows** — allowed access windows in **local machine time**, e.g. only
  during a nightly job. Outside every window the request is denied.
- **Required callers** — restrict a secret to specific caller identities, on top of
  the scope/caller rules.

Set them when adding a secret (repeatable flags), or later from the TUI classify
screen (`c`):

```bash
# Only Mon–Fri 09:00–18:00, and only the 'ci' caller.
svault secret add DEPLOY_KEY --scope deploy --tier high \
  --window "mon-fri 09:00-18:00" --require-caller ci
```

Window spec: `mon-fri 09:00-18:00`, `fri 10:00-12:00`, or `09:00-17:00` (no day =
any day); 24-hour `HH:MM`, start inclusive / end exclusive, same-day only (no
cross-midnight spans). Days are `mon`..`sun`, single / range / comma-list. View a
vault's conditions with `svault policy check <caller>`.

## Seal & escalate

Repeated denials are not just logged — they **seal** the secret. After
**5 denials within 5 minutes** on a *medium or high* secret (counted across any
caller, so rotating the `--caller` string doesn't help), Svault writes a **seal**
into the encrypted policy. While sealed, every gated agent `get` is denied — even
an otherwise-valid one — until a **human** clears it. An agent can never unseal a
secret or unlock a vault; a brute-force pattern is stopped and handed to a person
rather than ground down into a leak.

A seal blocks the **agent path only**. A human still reads the secret directly with
`svault secret get`, and is who clears the seal:

```bash
svault pending                 # list sealed secrets awaiting approval (all vaults)
svault approve DEPLOY_KEY -v prod   # clear the seal — agents may request it again
```

In the TUI, sealed secrets are marked in the secret browser; press `A` to approve
(clear) the selected one. Low-tier secrets never seal (they auto-allow — there is
nothing to grind against).

## Per-secret classification (encrypted)

Classification lives **AES-256-GCM encrypted inside `vault.enc`** — so a same-UID
attacker can neither read a tier/scope/purpose at rest (no recon) nor downgrade it
without the passphrase. Set it when adding a secret:

```bash
svault secret add DB_PASSWORD --scope database --tier high --description "prod Postgres DSN"
svault secret add API_KEY      --scope api      --tier medium --require-reason
```

Each secret carries `scope`, `tier`, `require_reason`, and an optional
`description` (what it's for — passed to the AI judge as context). Interactively,
`svault secret add NAME` prompts for scope, tier (defaulting to the vault's
`default_tier`, chosen at `svault create`), and description. A `"*"` entry in the
classification map acts as the default for any unlisted secret.

## Caller rules (encrypted, per-vault)

Caller definitions — who may request which scopes, and at what rate limit — live
**encrypted inside the vault**, next to the classification. There is no longer a
committable `svault.policy.yaml`; everything that would help an agent plan a
bypass is unreadable at rest. Seed defaults with `svault policy init` and edit
them in `svault settings`. Conceptually a vault's caller rules look like:

```yaml
callers:
  claude-code:
    scopes: [database, api]
    rate_limit: 20/hour
  default:                 # applies to any unlisted caller
    scopes: []
    rate_limit: 5/hour
```

When a vault has no caller rules, caller authorization falls back to the vault's
`allow_agent` / `rate_limit`. (Team policy-as-code sharing — a committable, signed
export of caller rules — is planned as an explicit opt-in, separate from at-rest
storage.)

## The AI judge

See [security.md](security.md#ai-judge) for setup. In short: judges live in the
AES-256-GCM-encrypted keyring (`.svault/keyring.enc`). Create it (`svault keyring
init`), add one or more **named judges** (`svault judge add <name>` — each carries
its own model, thresholds, free-text criteria, and an API key of its own or via
a named **provider**), turn the judge on
globally (`svault judge enable`), and unlock the keyring (`svault keyring unlock`).
Each vault opts in via its per-vault toggle and uses the keyring's **default**
judge unless assigned a specific one with `svault settings` (or the TUI). The
daemon then scores the `reason` on every
medium/high request from the unlocked keyring. Verify a judge without touching a
secret:

```bash
svault keyring init                                                               # one-time
svault judge add strict                                                           # model + criteria + key (encrypted)
svault judge enable && svault keyring unlock
svault judge test --judge strict --reason "run the nightly database migration" --scope database --tier high
```

## Helper commands

- `svault policy init` — seed default caller rules into a vault's encrypted policy (unlocks the vault).
- `svault policy check <caller>` — unlock the vault and show a caller's scopes, the classified secrets it can reach, its rate limit, any conditional access (windows / required callers), sealed secrets, and recent activity / denials.
- `svault pending [VAULT]` — list sealed secrets awaiting human approval (one vault, or all).
- `svault approve <secret> -v <vault>` — clear a seal so agents may request the secret again (human-only).

Every request is appended to `.svault/<vault>/audit.log` (gitignored, mode `0600`).
